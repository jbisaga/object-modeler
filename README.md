# object-modeler
Create a model from an array of (preferably) similar JS objects.

Maybe it's a bunch of MongoDB documents or SQL result rows from a collection you're unfamiliar with. Maybe it's just the output of some module with poor documentation.
Either way this will give you a model object compiled from all given objects.
